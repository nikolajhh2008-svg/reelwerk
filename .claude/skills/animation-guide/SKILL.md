description: Excerpt from John Heibel's ANIMATION_GUIDE.md on timing and character animation - write the viewer's "reads" and give each time to land, one read at a time, fast actions and slow meanings, the classic animation principles, transitions that belong to the story, and a three-zoom review loop (contact sheet, strip, crop). Use when timing a video's moments, animating a character or reviewing motion in rendered frames.

> **Excerpt. Changes:** only the parts from "The three goals" through "Workflow 3" and "Common failures" are included, otherwise word for word. Removed: everything about the Clawd character (its reference section and the code example in "2. Build"); mentions of Clawd in the remaining rules are replaced by "the character". Removed as well: the "Handmade" goal (so two of the three goals remain), rule 1 (the p5.brush medium, boil, flat 2D, glow, palette) and rule 2 ("No text"), the "Nothing is ever still" and "Clawd is big" items, the checks and common failures that belong to those rules, and a pointer to the demo example that is not included. The original rule numbers are kept. Function names, files and commands in the text (e.g. `emotions()`, `ease`, `render.mjs`, `src/config.js`) refer to the original kit's p5.js engine, which is not included.

## The three goals

Every rule below serves one of three goals.

- **Alive.** Something is always moving and something is always happening. Faces act instead of snapping, and characters are big enough to feel.
- **One piece.** It's one short film, not a pile of clips. Plan it before you draw it, and link every scene to the next.

Underneath all three, the viewer has to be able to follow it. Timing (rule 4) is the rule models get wrong most often.

## The rules

### 3. Something happens in every scene

- **Every shot needs an event:** something changes between its first frame and its last. The character wants something, finds something, tries, fails, reacts or gets it. "The character stands in a meadow being cute" is not a shot.
- **One focal action at a time.** Stage it with a clear silhouette and nothing competing for attention, so it reads at a glance.
- **Cause, then reaction.** When something happens, the character reacts to it: a take, an emotion change, a turn toward it. The reaction is often the funniest part, so give it time.
- **Pay it off.** Whatever you set up in a shot (a door, a sandwich, a strange noise) gets resolved on screen, in that shot or a later one.

### 4. Timing: model the viewer

Timing turns a set of drawings into a story. It's also where generated animation fails most often: everything moves at one brisk speed, events pile on top of each other, and moments are over before anyone understands them.

You know what happens because you wrote the code. The viewer doesn't: they see it once, at full speed, for the first time. **For every moment, ask what the viewer needs to understand and how long that will take them, and time it for that.**

- **Write the reads.** For each shot, list in order what the viewer has to understand. Each item is a *read*. Every read needs time for the eye to find it, time to understand it, and a moment to register before the next thing starts. Small, distant, fast or subtle things take longer to find and understand than big, central, obvious ones.
- **One read at a time.** Don't start a new read while the viewer is still taking in the last one. When two things happen at once, the viewer sees only one of them. Put a cause and its reaction in sequence, not on top of each other.
- **Fast actions, slow meanings.** A motion can be very quick if it's anticipated, but what it means needs held time. Anticipation tells the viewer where to look before the action, and the hold after it lets them understand it. Move quickly through what doesn't matter to the story, and spend time on what does. That contrast between quick and held is what gives a film rhythm; one constant speed, fast or slow, makes it flat and hard to follow.
- **Lead the eye.** The viewer looks at whatever moves, is bright, is big or is being looked at. Before an important read, get their eye to the right place (a character looks at it, the camera moves to it, it moves or lights up first), and give the eye time to get there.
- **Let the reads set the length.** A shot is as long as its reads need. A shot with many reads can't be short, and a shot whose reads have all landed shouldn't be padded. That includes the last shot: its final read needs time to land before the video ends.

### 5. Alive

- **Faces act, they never snap.** Change moods with `emotions()`. It does anticipation, a squint, a take and overshoot around every change. Never swap `eyes`/`mouth` by hand between two frames.
- **Move like a cartoon, not a machine.** Every move follows the animation principles in the next section.
- **Everything moves on a beat.** `PROJECT.bpm` drives every idle, bounce and dance, so the whole film shares one pulse. Put the hits on beats (`pulse()`, `beatN()`), even with no music.

### 6. Transitions always

- **Every seam gets a transition:** into the first shot, between every pair of shots and out of the last one. Never start on a hard frame, and never just stop.
- **Pick a transition that belongs to the story**, and don't default to the same one every time. Some options:
  - a brush wipe (`brushWipe`)
  - an iris or shaped iris (`iris`, `irisShape`)
  - a whip pan with a smear
  - a match cut (the same shape or motion across the cut)
  - a cut on action (cut mid-move, and finish the move in the next shot)
  - a camera move that carries through into the next shot
  - a fade or push from paper or black
- A plain cut is fine only when it's on action or a deliberate smash cut.
- **Changes inside a shot are transitions too:** emotions go through `emotions()` and turns go through `turn()`. Props arrive and leave on arcs, never popping in.

### 7. One piece: a vision before any code

- **Storyboard first**, in writing, before you write any scene code (the workflow below has the format). If you're working with a person, show them the storyboard and let them react before you build.
- **One world.** Pick a palette and a setting that carries through, with a colour arc across the video (e.g. cold night → warm dawn as the character's mood lifts).
- **One thread.** The story has a beginning, a middle and an end, and the character's emotional arc follows it. Plan the emotion keys across the whole video, not per shot.
- **Rhyme the ending with the opening:** the same place, pose or motif, changed. It makes the film feel whole.
- **Link scenes:** motion continues across cuts, and screen direction stays consistent (if the character travels right, keep travelling right). Props and characters carry over.

## Animation principles

These are the classic principles of character animation, as they apply here. Most of them fix one problem: motion written as code comes out mechanical, because code moves every part at once, on the same curve, by the same amount.

- **Anticipation.** Before a big move, make a small move the opposite way: a crouch before a jump, a wind-up before a throw, a squint before a take. It tells the viewer something is coming and where to look. `jump()` and `emotions()` build it in.
- **Squash and stretch.** Bodies squash on impact and stretch when they move fast, keeping their volume (`sq`).
- **Slow in, slow out.** Almost nothing moves at a constant speed. Things ease out of one pose and into the next. A plain `lerp` over time looks mechanical, so run its progress through an easing (`ease`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `backOut`).
- **Weight.** How something starts and stops says what it weighs. Heavy things take longer to get going and to stop, and land with little bounce. Light things snap into motion, bounce and flutter to rest.
- **Arcs.** Living things move on arcs, not straight lines: thrown props, hops, arm swings, head turns (`arcPt`).
- **Overlapping action and follow-through.** Don't move every part at once. The eyes lead, the body follows, and arms, hats, props and tails drag behind, overshoot and settle last. Offset each part's timing a little from the one it hangs off (`spring`, `ring` and `backOut` for the settle).
- **Avoid twinning.** Code copies values, so both arms end up at the same angle, both eyes blink together and a crowd bounces in unison. Give one arm the action and the other something smaller, and offset timings, phases and `seed`s between characters.
- **Exaggeration.** Push poses, takes, squash and leans further than feels natural. In a short cartoon, subtle reads as nothing. If it looks like too much on the sheet, pull it back.
- **Strong key poses.** Each shot's storytelling poses should read as stills, with a clear silhouette and the body leaning into what it's doing, before any motion goes between them. If the key poses don't read, the motion won't fix it.
- **Show the thought.** A character notices, thinks, then acts, and the eyes move first. The viewer understands a choice when they see it being made.
- **Secondary action.** Small actions that support the main one (a hat bobbing, an emote popping, grass stirring) add life, but they never compete with it.

## Workflow

### 1. Storyboard

Write `STORYBOARD.md` before any scene code:

```
Logline: one sentence. The character wants ___, but ___, so ___.
World: setting, a small palette, light, how the colour changes across the video.
Motif: the thing that recurs and pays off.
Character's arc: the emotion keys across the whole video.
Shots:
  A  start–end  [transition in: ___]  what's seen · the EVENT · the character's reaction · camera
     reads:  start–end  the first thing the viewer must understand
             start–end  the next one (where is the viewer's eye when it starts?)
             ...
  B  start–end  [transition: ___]  ...
  ...
  [transition out: ___]
```

The reads are the timing sheet. Give each one a start and an end, make sure each has time to be found and understood, and make sure no two important reads overlap. If a shot's reads don't fit its length, lengthen the shot or cut a read; don't squeeze them.

Check the storyboard against the rules:
- Is there an event in every shot?
- Does every read have time to land before the next one starts?
- Is there a transition at every seam?
- Does the ending rhyme with the opening?

### 2. Build

- Set `duration` (and `bpm`) in [src/config.js](src/config.js).
- Put your scene in a new file (e.g. `src/scenes/my_video.js`), wrapped in an IIFE, and end it with `shots([...])`. In [studio.html](studio.html), **replace** the `demo.js` script tag with yours.
- Build and check one shot at a time, in order.
- Within a shot, block the key poses first and check them as stills (`--sheet` at the key times). Add the motion between them once they read.

### 3. Look at it: the review loop

You can't see motion by reading code. Render and look at every shot, several times, at three zoom levels:

```bash
# contact sheet: the shape of the whole piece (every shot's first, middle and last frames)
node render.mjs --sheet=0.1,0.8,1.6,2.4,3.1,3.9 --cols=6 --w=320 --out=out/check/sheet.jpg
# strip: EVERY frame of a moment (turns, takes, jumps, throws, transitions)
node render.mjs --strip=2.1:2.6 --cols=6 --w=320 --out=out/check/strip.jpg
# crop: full-resolution detail (faces, hands, contacts, glows); crop=x,y,w,h in frame pixels
node render.mjs --sheet=2.3,2.4 --crop=760,420,500,400 --w=500 --out=out/check/face.jpg
# crop-at: the same, following a WORLD point through each frame's camera (a foot or a prop on a moving shot);
# x,y in world pixels (or an expression evaluated in the page), w,h in frame pixels
node render.mjs --strip=2.1:2.6 --crop-at=960,700,500,400 --out=out/check/feet.jpg
```

Open each image and actually look at it. Check:

- **Read:** is the event of each shot clear from its sheet alone? Is the character big enough, and does the character separate from the background?
- **Timing.** You can't judge timing from single frames, so read it like a viewer:
  - Render the shot as a sheet at a fixed step (every 0.1–0.15 s) and read it in order.
  - At each frame ask: where is the viewer looking right now, and do they understand it yet?
  - Count the frames each read gets (24 frames = 1 s). A read that flashes by in a few frames, or shares its frames with another read, will be missed.
  - After each important moment, is there time to take it in before the next thing starts?
- **Motion:** in strips, does every move have anticipation and follow-through? Are there any pops, jumps or snaps between frames? Do the parts move at different times, or all at once? Is anything moving at a constant speed, or mirrored left and right? Are the poses pushed far enough to read?
- **Contacts:** do feet touch the ground? Do held things touch the arm tips? Do thrown things leave from the hand?
- **Transitions:** check the first and last 0.5 s of every shot and every seam. Does it open and close with a transition?
- **Rules:** is there any dead stretch where nothing is happening?

Fix what you find, then look again. **Budget:** at least one sheet per shot, a strip for every key motion and transition, and a crop for every face that carries the story. Contact sheets run about 0.1–1 s per frame, so this is cheap: don't skip it.

## Common failures

These are the things that make a video look generated. Check your storyboard and sheets against them:

- the character standing still and smiling while nothing happens
- everything moving at one brisk speed, with events stacked on top of each other and no holds
- moments that are over before the viewer understands them
- a tiny character in a big empty landscape for the whole video
- faces that snap from one expression to another
- mechanical motion: linear moves, every part moving at once, both arms or several characters in sync
- timid poses and takes that barely read
- hard cuts everywhere, or a video that just starts and stops
- props floating near a hand instead of touching it
- every shot a different world with nothing linking them
