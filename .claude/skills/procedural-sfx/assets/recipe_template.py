"""Project-specific recipes. Copy this file next to your project, rename, and add functions.

Every public function becomes a recipe type usable in events.json:
  python mix.py events.json --recipes my_recipes.py
  python render_sfx.py --recipes my_recipes.py door_slam -o door.wav

Rules that keep recipes composable:
  - return a mono numpy array, peak-normalised with norm(...) * v
  - take v=1.0 plus keyword arguments with sensible defaults (events pass them via "args")
  - get randomness only from noise() / rand() / uniform(), so mix.py can seed each event
  - write the docstring's first line as "what it sounds like: how it is built"
  - status: recipes from this file count as 'new' (not ear-tuned) in --list and in mix.py's "not ear-tuned yet"
    list. Once the user has listened and approved one, mark it: `door_slam.status = 'tuned'` after the def.
