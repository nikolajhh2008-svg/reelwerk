# Master a mix for delivery: bring it to a loudness target with ONE static gain change, never touching the dynamics.
#   sh master.sh mix.wav out.wav [target_LUFS=-14] [true_peak_dBTP=-1]
# -14 LUFS suits YouTube/Spotify/social; -16 podcasts/Apple; -23 (EBU R128) or -24 (ATSC, with -2 dBTP) broadcast.
# Pass 1 measures integrated loudness and true peak with ffmpeg's ebur128 filter (peak=true), parsed from its
# "Summary:" block (I: ... LUFS, Peak: ... dBFS; one decimal, so 0.05 dB is allowed for rounding). ebur128 agreed with
# an independent BS.1770 implementation to 0.05 LU on test mixes, while loudnorm's own measurement read a sparse SFX
# mix ~0.6 LU loud. Pass 2 applies volume=<target - measured>dB and nothing else: loudnorm is never used, because
# its dynamic mode (which its "linear" mode falls back to when the target is out of reach) compresses and can pump.
# If that gain would push the true peak over the limit, nothing is written: the error names the loudest target that
# fits (lower the loudest events and remix to get closer). Output: 24-bit PCM wav at the input's sample rate
# (plays everywhere; the true-peak limit keeps samples under full scale, so fixed point cannot clip). It is rendered
# to a temp file next to the output, re-measured, and only then moved into place: a failed or interrupted run never
# leaves a partial file, and the input can never be written to (same-file check covers symlinks and hard links).
# The re-measured loudness must land within 0.15 LU of the target (0.1 plus the meter's rounding). Integrated loudness
# is gated, so a gain change can move blocks across the -70 LUFS / relative gates and the first gain can miss; the
# gain is then corrected from the original (never re-applied to the output) up to 3 more times before giving up.
# mux.sh runs this first, so video and audio-only deliveries share the same linear-only policy.
# Exit status: 0 = written and re-measured; 1 = input problem or unreachable target, explained as "error: ... / fix: ...".
