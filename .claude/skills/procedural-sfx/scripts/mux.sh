# Put a mix under a video, loudness-mastered with a single linear gain change (master.sh does that part).
#   sh mux.sh video.mp4 mix.wav out.mp4 [target_LUFS=-14] [true_peak_dBTP=-1]
# -14 LUFS suits YouTube/Spotify/social; -16 podcasts/Apple; -23 (EBU R128) or -24 (ATSC, with -2 dBTP) broadcast.
# master.sh measures, refuses a target that would need more gain than the true-peak limit allows (and names the
# loudest reachable one), and writes the gained wav; this script copies the video stream and encodes that audio to
# AAC 256k.
# The video is the timeline: every video packet is copied (no -shortest, which drops the last frames of a copied
# B-frame stream when the audio ends at the same instant), and the mix is padded with silence or trimmed to the
# video's span BEFORE mastering, so the loudness target applies to the audio that ships (a warning says when the mix
# length differs). The video's span comes from its packet timestamps, not from container durations. The mix REPLACES any audio the video already has;
# a warning says so (to keep it, extract it and pass it to mix.py --music).
# Before the result replaces anything at the output path it is verified: same video packet count and duration as
# the source, audio as long as the video, loudness within 0.5 LU of the target and true peak at or under the limit
# after AAC (AAC can add a few tenths of a dB of overs; if it crosses the limit, nothing is written and the error
# names the quieter target that fits). Everything is built in a private temp folder next to the output and moved
# into place only once verified; the output is never one of the inputs (symlinks and hard links included).
# Exit status: 0 = written and verified; 1 = input problem, unreachable target or failed check, explained as
# "error: ... / fix: ...".
