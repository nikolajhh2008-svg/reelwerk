/**
 * gpu-preference.ts — run the render's Chrome on the high-performance GPU (Windows).
 *
 * On a machine with an integrated and a discrete GPU, Windows starts an app on the
 * power-saving GPU unless the app has its own entry under Settings > System > Display >
 * Graphics. Remotion's Chrome is a private chrome-headless-shell.exe inside the workspace,
 * so without an entry the whole render runs on the integrated GPU. Neither `gl: "angle"`
 * nor a page asking for powerPreference "high-performance" (React Three Fiber's default)
 * moves it: WebGL and WebGPU both stay on the integrated GPU until the entry exists
 * (measured on an Intel UHD + RTX 4060 laptop).
 *
 * preferHighPerformanceGpu(executable) writes that entry before Chrome starts: the same
 * value the Settings page writes, under HKCU, no admin rights. An entry that already holds
 * a GPU preference is the user's own choice and stays as it is. Nothing here fails a
 * render; a registry error comes back as a warning line. Off Windows it does nothing.
 * Library: import { preferHighPerformanceGpu } from "./gpu-preference.ts".
